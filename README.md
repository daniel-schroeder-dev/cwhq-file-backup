# CWHQ File Backup

The CWHQ File Backup script allows CWHQ users to create compressed archives of project folders and download them locally.

## Installation

Create a file called `main.py` in the root of your Editor's file system and copy the contents of [https://github.com/daniel-schroeder-dev/cwhq-file-zipper/blob/main/main.py](https://github.com/daniel-schroeder-dev/cwhq-file-zipper/blob/main/main.py) into the file.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` file to execute the app. 

You'll need to provide two pieces of configuration each time you run the app:
1. Your CWHQ username
2. Your preferred archive format
